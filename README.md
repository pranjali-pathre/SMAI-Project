# SMAI-Project

## Projec ID: 3 | Team Agile
### TOPIC: Scale-Invariant Feature Transform
### PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Image matching is a fundamental aspect of many problems in computer vision, including
object or scene recognition, solving for 3D structure from multiple images, stereo correspondence, and motion tracking. 

We present a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The obtained features are invariant to image scaling and rotation, partially invariant to illumination, well localized in spatial and frequency domains, and highly distinct which allows us to match features with high accuracy. The cost of extracting the features is reduced by using a cascade filtering approach. 
### EVALUATION TIMELINE:
